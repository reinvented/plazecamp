#summary The schedule of activities for PlazeCamp

!PlazeCamp will be very informal, and much of what happens will be self-directed by those that attend.  We've set up a general framework for the day as follows:

|| 10:00 a.m. || [TheLocation Plazes HQ] opens to !PlazeCamp participants ||
|| 11:00 a.m. || Welcome to !PlazeCamp - introduction to the day ||
|| 11:10 a.m. || Introduction to the new Plazes API by [http://plazes.com/users/266 Tilmann Singer], Plazes developer - a brief overview of the Plazes object model, and the details of the Plazes API ||
|| 11:30 a.m. || Opportunity for Q&A with Plazes Development Team ||
|| 2:00 p.m. || Lunch (in-house, provided by Plazes) ||
|| 7:00 p.m. || Show and Tell - opportunity to present hacks, offer feedback on the API ||
|| 8:30 p.m. || Dinner (in-house, provided by Plazes) ||
|| Midnight || Plazes HQ closes (open-ended) ||

All of the activities above are "optional" -- the space is large enough that you'll be able to continue working on your hack and ignore "formal" events if you'd like to.

Members of the Plazes Development Team will be on-site through !PlazeCamp to answer questions, fix bugs, and point the way.
