#summary Things the Plazes API can't do right now, but maybe it could someday...

Use this page to document feature requests for the [http://plazes.com/api/docs Plazes API].  Try to be as descriptive as possible with your feature request, and include a use case if possible.

Please note that, in general, the new Plazes API is considerably more 'atomic' than the old one -- for example, some methods will return you a reference to a Plazes users' ID which you then have to use to make a second API call to get their user details. This 'atomicity' was a deliberate design decision, and while it pushes some of the application logic out into your own application, it also makes the API much simpler and more general-purpose.

==Latitude/Longitude Parameter for GET /plazes.xml==

===Requested By===

[http://ruk.ca/ Peter Rukavina]

===Feature Description===

Currently the *GET /plazes.xml* method supports only the *q* parameter (which does a keyword search of name, address, zip_code, city, state (and full state name), country_code (and country names) category and tags fields) and the *mac_address* parameter.

There is, however, no way to pass a geographic point (latitude/longitude) as a parameter, allowing one to say, in effect, "here is where I am, show me all the nearby Plazes."

===Why this would be useful===

Having such a parameter would allow for experiments with mobile device/GPS integration -- for example, creating an applocation for a GPS-enabled mobile device that could provide a location-aware list of nearby plazes, perhaps filtered by category.

It would also allow for web-based mapping mash-ups that pass the centre point of the map, get back a collection of Plazes, and map them.

==Oauth authorization==

===Requested By===
[http://till.klampaeckel.de Till Klampaeckel]

===Feature Description===
Oauth is used to allow users to interact with applications without having them to supply their username/password combination. Typical use cases include widgets, desktop apps and so on. For a more detailed explaination see [http://oauth.net/ oauth.net] :) It would also improve performance since you wouldn't need to request all resources using SSL.

===Why this would be useful===
Users wouldn't need to give out the username/password to third-party apps

==Postcode / Address search for plaze ==

===Requested by Lance Wicks===

===Feature Description===
The ability to search for a plaze by postcode or street address.

===Why this would be useful===
When building apps via the API we could find a plaze that pre exists at a physical location.
