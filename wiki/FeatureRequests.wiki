#summary Things the Plazes API can't do right now, but maybe it could someday...

Use this page to document feature requests for the Plazes API.

==Latitude/Longitude Parameter for GET /plazes.xml==

===Requested By===

[http://ruk.ca/ Peter Rukavina]

===Feature Description===

Currently the *GET /plazes.xml* method supports only the *q* parameter (which does a keyword search of name, address, zip_code, city, state (and full state name), country_code (and country names) category and tags fields) and the *mac_address* parameter.

There is, however, no way to pass a geographic point (latitude/longitude) as a parameter, allowing one to say, in effect, "here is where I am, show me all the nearby Plazes."

===Why this would be useful===

Having such a parameter would allow for experiments with mobile device/GPS integration -- for example, creating an applocation for a GPS-enabled mobile device that could provide a location-aware list of nearby plazes, perhaps filtered by category.

It would also allow for web-based mapping mash-ups that pass the centre point of the map, get back a collection of Plazes, and map them.
