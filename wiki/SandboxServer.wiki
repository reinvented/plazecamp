#summary Information about sandbox.plazes.com

There is a server available if you want to try out the Plazes API using realistic data but without affecting the live service and any live user accounts.

Simply replace the hostname *plazes.com* with *sandbox.plazes.com* in any request and it will go to that test server instead of the live Plazes service. It is also accessible via web browser at http://sandbox.plazes.com

It runs with a copy of the live data from January 9, 2008. That means if you had an account on plazes.com yesterday, it will work with the same login and password on sandbox.plazes.com, otherwise you can just create one via the web. The data will be refreshed with a new copy from the life site from time to time, which will also erase any
changes being made on sandbox in between.

The sandbox.plazes.com server will not send out any emails.
