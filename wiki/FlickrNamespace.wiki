#summary Tagging Flickr photos with their Plazes' metadata

Following the [http://www.flickr.com/groups/api/discuss/72157594497877875 Flickr documentation for machine tag format] I propose the following be the standard for tagging Flickr photos with information about their Plaze:

*plazes:id=![plaze_id]*

Tag a photo with the Plaze it's taken at (or taken of).

For example:

{{{plazes:id=87873}}}

[http://flickr.com/search/?w=all&q=plazes%3Aid%3D87873&m=tags]

*plazes:activity_id=[activity_id]*

Tag a photo with the Plazes Activity it's taken at (or taken of).

For example:

{{{plazes:activity_id=5841109}}}
