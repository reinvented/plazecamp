## January 12, 2008 at [Plazes HQ](http://plazes.com/plazes/87873_plazes_hq) in Berlin, Germany ##

PlazeCamp -- aka "Plazes Developer Day" -- was an opportunity for third-party developers to join the Plazes development team at [Plazes HQ](http://plazes.com/plazes/87873_plazes_hq) in Berlin for a day of learning, mashing-up, hacking, developing, questioning, and generally exploring the capabilities of the Plazes API.

PlazeCamp was not a formal conference, but rather an open day for interested developers, designers, and people generally interested in Plazes and presence to come together in the same place to "hack together."

Now that the PlazeCamp _physical_ event is over ([see a wrap up of what happened here](http://blog.plazes.com/?p=222)), this Google Code project can live on as a repository for information, code, and tips for using the Plazes API.
