Plazes is on the first floor of the building.  When you arrive look for the sign on the door.

The space is large and bright ([video](http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=8178401861063940303&q=plazes&pr=goog-sl)), and there are areas for small group discussion.

**Please bring your own laptop**. An open wifi network will be available to attendees.
