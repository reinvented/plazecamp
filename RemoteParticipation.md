If you cannot be physically present at PlazeCamp, you can participate via IRC:

**[irc://freenode.org#plazes*](irc://freenode.org#plazes*)**

What exactly the IRC channel will be used for, and the extent to which you'll be able to get a realistic experience of PlazeCamp this way will depend on the participation of the on-site participants.

We don't plan to make an "official" streaming audio or video available from Plazes HQ, although participants may choose to set up streams of their own.  We may have audio or video recordings of selected portions of PlazeCamp available after the fact.
